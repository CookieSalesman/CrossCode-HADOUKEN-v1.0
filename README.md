# CrossCode-HADOUKEN-v1.0
A mod for the game CrossCode; Lea yells various forms of HADOUKEN when casting appropriate combat arts. Video demo coming soon.
(It's more or less a joke mod.)

Installation is simple! simply drag \hadouken\ into \CrossCode\assets\mods\
Requires CCloader, an equally simple-to-install mod. Link given for convenience (github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader). This mod is easily toggleable through the options menu.

The way this mod has been written, it will be as compatible as possible, meaning it is extraordinarly unlikely to cause any conflict.
