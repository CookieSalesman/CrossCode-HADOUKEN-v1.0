# CrossCode-HADOUKEN-v1.0
A mod for the game CrossCode; Lea yells various forms of HADOUKEN or SHORYUKEN when casting appropriate combat arts. Video demo coming soon (24-48 hrs). I suggest just seeing if it makes you laugh a bit when used.

Showcase: youtu.be/6F0D6_hfezU

Installation is simple! simply drag \hadouken\ into \CrossCode\assets\mods\
Requires CCloader, an equally simple-to-install mod. Link given for convenience (github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader). This mod is easily toggleable through the options menu.

The way this mod has been written, it will be as compatible as possible, meaning it is extraordinarly unlikely to cause any conflict.


If you're new to modding take a look at this better mod! (https://github.com/Hsifnus/autumns-genesis)


To be specific, it only modifies a few fire combat arts.
