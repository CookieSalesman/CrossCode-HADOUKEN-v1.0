# CrossCode-HADOUKEN-v1.0
A mod for the game CrossCode; Lea yells various forms of HADOUKEN when casting appropriate combat arts. Video demo coming soon.
(It's more or less a joke mod.)

Installation is simple! simply drag \hadouken\ into \CrossCode\assets\mods\
Requires CCloader, an equally simple-to-install mod. Link given for convenience (github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader). This mod is easily toggleable through the options menu.

It has been written to be as compatible as possible (ACAP)!
